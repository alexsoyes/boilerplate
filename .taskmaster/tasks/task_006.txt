# Task ID: 6
# Title: Develop Duplicate Detection System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create algorithm to check for existing links in the repository to prevent duplicates
# Details:
Implement duplicate checking algorithm that compares URLs and content. Parse existing README file to extract all current links. Create fuzzy matching for similar URLs (different protocols, trailing slashes, query parameters). Implement content-based similarity checking using extracted metadata. Add caching system for repository contents to improve performance.

# Test Strategy:
Test duplicate detection with exact matches, similar URLs, and different content. Verify false positive handling and performance with large number of existing links.
