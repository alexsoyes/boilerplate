# Task ID: 4
# Title: Create Web Parser for Link Analysis
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement web scraping functionality to extract metadata from provided URLs
# Details:
Install web scraping library (Puppeteer or Cheerio). Create parser functions to extract title, description, and content from URLs. Implement fallback mechanisms for sites that block scraping. Add timeout handling and error recovery for unreachable URLs. Extract Open Graph tags and meta tags for rich metadata. Handle different content types (websites, documentation, GitHub repos).

# Test Strategy:
Test with various URL types including documentation sites, GitHub repos, and regular websites. Verify metadata extraction accuracy and error handling for invalid URLs.
