# Title: Implement Ambassador Role Verification
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create permission system to verify users have 'ambassador' role before allowing link saving functionality
# Details:
Implement role checking middleware that verifies user has 'ambassador' role before executing save-link command. Create helper functions to check user permissions and handle unauthorized access attempts. Add proper error messages for users without required permissions. Include role caching system to minimize Discord API calls.

# Test Strategy:
Test with users having and not having ambassador role. Verify proper error messages and access control. Test role checking performance and caching.
